        <h2>Australian Rules Football</h2>
        <p>
            Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football,[2] or simply called "Aussie rules", "football" or "footy",
             is a contact sport played between two teams of 18 players on an oval field, often a modified cricket ground.
             Points are scored by kicking the oval ball between the middle goal posts (worth six points) or between a goal.
              and behind post (worth one point).During general play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part
               of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball.
