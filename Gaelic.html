        <h2>Gaelic Football</h2>
        <p>
            Gaelic football, commonly referred to as football or Gaelic, is an Irish team sport.
             It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking 
             or punching the ball into the other team's goals (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goals and over a crossbar 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) 
             above the ground (1 point).Players advance the football, a spherical leather ball resembling a volleyball, up the field with a combination of carrying,
              bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking the ball upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores 
              are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag.
               A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net, signalled by the umpire raising a green flag.
