# Project 0: Football webpage 

ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

## overview: 
This website is an assignment for the first lab of (Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies). In this app, I made six pages in which one page is the home page and the other pages are brief descriptions for five types of football games with supporting material in these pages like tables and images. You can move from any page to any other pages by using the last field at the bottom of the page. 

## system requirement:
- Any platform you like such as Windows, Linux, and so on. 
- use any browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome,...) to display the html pages. 

## Tools used:
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Bootstap 4 
- Sass (you can download and install it from this link [**Link**] (https://sass-lang.com/install))

## How to use program: 
- At first, open `home_page.html` file with any browser you like. 
![home_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26576895/105578883-f52aeb00-5d8b-11eb-9a72-688f5a989a1a.JPG)

- At the end of the page, you can choose any type of football you want to hold knowledge. 
- If you click on `the Association Football`, you will get a new window like this:
![Association1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26576895/105578959-69fe2500-5d8c-11eb-8111-8c6b2f1defcf.JPG)

- If you like to return back to the home page or surf another page, scroll down to get the grid at the bottom of the page (Bootstrap 4 grid), like the below figure, that has all options you want.
![Association2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26576895/105579098-0f18fd80-5d8d-11eb-9f13-b2fc4a0242c7.JPG)

- This grid exists in other pages but with a different layout to ease the moving from one page to another.
